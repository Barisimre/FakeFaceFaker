# FakeFaceFaker
Project for the course Deep Learning

Originally made in a notebook server I hosted on my PC by:
 - Baris Imre
 - Daan Middelkoop
 - Leo Heyns
 - Mauk Muller
 
 We use the celeba dataset with a VAE to generate fake faces. We then make a CNN to classify these from the real faces. Then we attack this classifier with different methods and experiment with defenses.
